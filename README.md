## Predict Melting Point of Proteins from DNA Sequences

This project focuses on predicting the melting point of proteins based on their DNA sequences. Melting point prediction is crucial for understanding protein stability and functionality, which has significant implications in fields like bioinformatics, structural biology, and drug design.

### Overview

The melting point of a protein is the temperature at which half of the protein molecules are in the folded state and half are in the unfolded state. Accurate prediction of this property can aid in various applications, including:

- **Protein Engineering**: Designing proteins with desired thermal stability.
- **Drug Development**: Understanding the stability of proteins involved in disease mechanisms.
- **Biotechnology**: Optimizing conditions for protein production and purification.

### Features

- **Data Processing**: 
  - Preprocessing DNA sequences and converting them into numerical features suitable for machine learning.
  - Handling and integrating various data formats and sources.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - Utilizes a neural network model (e.g., a ResNet-like architecture) for predicting protein melting points.
  - Incorporates advanced techniques such as dimensionality reduction (PCA) for handling varying dataset shapes.

- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - Trained on large datasets with rigorous validation to ensure model accuracy.
  - Evaluation metrics include loss, mean absolute error (MAE), Pearson correlation, and root mean squared error (RMSE).

- **Visualization and Analysis**:
  - Detailed plots of training history and model performance.
  - Comprehensive analysis of prediction results.
